== Description ==

This plugin is an extension to the WP-LinkedIn plugin that enables showing
LinkedIn profiles and recommendations for any registered user.

By default, the behavior of the [WP-LinkedIn plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-linkedin/)
will be changed so that shortcodes and widgets show the data of the author of
the post or page. If the plugin cannot decide whose data to show (e.g. on the
home page or archive pages) you can configure it to either show nothing or a
specific user's data.

This plugin also extends the `[li_profile]` shortcode and other shortcodes with
a new set of attributes that allow to specify which user's profile to show.

For example:

- `[li_profile id="1"]` will show the profile of the user with id 1.
- `[li_profile name="admin"]` will show the profile of the user whose username
is `admin`.
- `[li_profile email="admin@example.com"]` will show the profile of the user
whose email is `admin@example.com`.

**Keywords**

When specifying the `id` attribute, you can also indicate keywords instead of
explicit ids, the id will be calculated automatically depending on the keyword:

- `author`: is the author of the post, page or archive.
- `current`: is the currently logged in user (if no user is logged in an error
message will be displayed).
- `bp_displayed`: support for BuddyPress, shows the currently displayed
BuddyPress profile.
- `bp_current`: support for BuddyPress, shows the currently logged in
BuddyPress user.

**Regenerate Button**

Additionally the plugin also provides the `[li_token_button]` shortcode that
displays a "Regenerate Token" button on any post or page. Optional attributes
for that shortcode are:

- `button_label`: the label on the button.
- `before_error` and `after_error`: HTML code to put before and after an error
message.
- `before_success` and `after_success`: HTML code to put before and after a
success message.
- `redir`: the URL where the user should be redirected to in case of success.
If `redir` is not provided the user will be redirected to the current page.

NOTE: If the user is not connected the button will not show up.

**Connect with LinkedIn**

You can now configure the plugin to allow users to login to your website using
their LinkedIn account. The plugin will show a link on the WordPress log in page
and you can also use the `[li_login_button]` shortcode to display a "Connect with LinkedIn"
button anywhere of the site.  Optional attributes
for that shortcode are:

- `button_label`: the label on the button.
- `before_error` and `after_error`: HTML code to put before and after an error
message.
- `before_success` and `after_success`: HTML code to put before and after a
success message.
- `redir`: the URL where the user should be redirected to in case of success.
If `redir` is not provided the user will be redirected to the current page.

NOTE: If the user is already connected the button will not show up.

**Deprecated**

The `[li_user]` shortcode has been deprecated and the recommended method
is now to use the extended attributes to explicitly set the user.

License purchase includes 1 year of product support and updates.
